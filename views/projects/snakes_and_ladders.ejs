                    This project was inspired by The Coding Traing challenge # 91.
                    It's my first time using the P5 library and my first project from
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjgXvBlbQiydffZU7m1_aw">The Coding Train.</a>
                    Overall, I don't think this was a good choice for a first project by him.
                    It's one of his larger projects, and I'm not sure that he had fully hashed out
                    his idea before he started programming.

                    This snakes and ladders game generates random snakes and ladders
                    on the board and then moves the player around the board and
                    calculates the number of rolls taken to reach the end.
                </p>

                    I have a lot to learn about the p5 library. I ran into a lot
                    of problems while trying to make this work that were really just
                    not knowing the p5 syntax, but I can see how using this library
                    will be worth it to learn some more programming methods.
